# Hispathologic cancer detection competition in Kaggle 

The goal of this repository is to participate to the Hispathologic cancer detection competition in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection). The goal of this competition is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that can detect metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.
